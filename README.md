ES6 introduces modern JavaScript features like promises, classes, and data manipulation techniques, while TypeScript adds static typing for better error handling, and Node.js allows server-side JavaScript execution, with testing frameworks like Jest used for unit testing, and .gitignore helps manage files excluded from version control.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x00  | [ES6 Basic](./0x00-ES6_basic/)                                                                                      |**ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** introduces modern JavaScript features like **let/const** for variable declarations, **arrow functions**, **template literals**, **classes**, **modules**, **destructuring assignment**, and **promises**, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and asynchronous programming.|            
| 0x01  | [ES6 Promise](./0x01-ES6_promise/)                                                                                     |**ES6 Promises** provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, later, or never, and allow chaining of `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for error handling, improving code readability and avoiding callback hell.|
| 0x02  | [ES6 Classes](./0x02-ES6_classes/)                                                                                      |**ES6 Classes** provide a more structured and object-oriented way to define objects and deal with inheritance in JavaScript. They offer a clearer syntax for creating objects, constructors, methods, and extending classes, making the code more readable and maintainable.|                                                                                                                                                                 
| 0x03  | [ES6 Data Manipulation](./0x03-ES6_data_manipulation/)                                                                  |**ES6 Data Manipulation** introduces new features like **destructuring**, **spread/rest operators**, and **Map/Set** objects to simplify and improve the handling of data. These features allow easier extraction, modification, and management of data structures like arrays and objects. |
| 0x04  | [TypeScript](./0x04-TypeScript/)                                                                                        | **TypeScript** is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations to JavaScript, enabling early detection of errors during development. It offers features like **interfaces**, **classes**, **enums**, and **modules**, which improve code maintainability, readability, and scalability. TypeScript code is compiled to standard JavaScript for execution in browsers or Node.js environments.               |
| 0x05  | [Node JS Basics](./0x05-Node_JS_basic/)                                                                                 |**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable and fast applications, particularly for real-time and data-intensive applications.               |
| 0x06  | [Unittests in JS](./0x06-unittests_in_js/)                                                                              | **Unit tests in JavaScript** are used to test individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they behave as expected. Popular frameworks like **Jest**, **Mocha**, and **Jasmine** provide tools for writing and running unit tests, offering features like assertions, test suites, and mocks to verify functionality.               |
